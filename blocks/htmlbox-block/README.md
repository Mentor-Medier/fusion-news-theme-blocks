# `@wpmedia/htmlbox-block`
HTML Box for block for Fusion News Theme

## Usage
It expects the `HTML` custom field to be filled out with an embed link
```
credits: {
    by: [{
        name: ...
        url: ...
        ...
    }]
}
```

If the `HTML` custom field is not populated then nothing will be rendered.
