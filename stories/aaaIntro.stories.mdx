# Theme Blocks

**beta: 5.0.2-beta.0 latest:5.0.11 stable: 5.0.11**

Itâ€™s a collection of React components designed to:

- Speed up design and development velocity
- Help create consistent and usable functionality in our various websites
- Promote best practices for accessibility and responsive web design

We hope to accomplish these goals by:

- Reducing the number of decisions needed when iterating on UI
- Reducing the amount of code duplication in our apps
- Providing easy-to-use and extensible components for anyone to consume

## Install

Add theme block to your project.

`npm install --save @wpmedia/share-bar-block`

Add to your `blocks.json`.

`@wpmedia/share-bar-block@version`

### **Use**

Import components you want into your project

`import { ShareBar } from '@wpmedia/share-bar-block';`

and use them like so

```

const data = () => ({
  customFields: {
    email: false,
    facebook: true,
    pinterest: false,
    twitter: false,
    linkedIn: false,
  },
  globalContent: {
    label: {
      basic: {
        display: true,
        url: 'http://google.com/',
        text: 'Overline Text Root',
      },
    },
  },
});

  <ShareBar fusionContext={data} />
```


### **Local Development**

You can test Engine SDK components locally by adding the following properties to yout blocks.json:
-  `"useLocal": true`
- `"devBlocks": ["@wpmedia/share-bar-block"]`
## How To Publish

1. Pull the latest `staging` branch.

    - `git checkout staging`

    - `git fetch -a`

2. Branch off the `staging` branch

    - `git checkout -b PEN-[jira ticket num]-[brief description of feature]`

3. Do the work, commit as you go, which will run the linter and tests.

4. Make pull request using GitHub against the `staging` branch. 

    - Get approval for your pr on your feature branch.

5. Merge into `staging` branch. A CI/CD will publish.

6. Go to new theme feature pack's `blocks.json`
    - Change your engine block to the `@beta` release in the blocks list (eg, `"@wpmedia/header-nav"` -> `"@wpmedia/header-nav@beta"`).
    - Make a pr against the news theme repo making that change to the `master` branch. 
    - Then publish that change using deployment strategy to the `staging` environment (corecomponents prod is a `staging` env). 
    - Alert quality assurance stakeholder that the change has been published.

7. After design qa and qa approval, make a pull request from the `staging` branch to the `master` branch. (Should we make a new pr for just your staging changes?)

8. Once the pr has been approved, merge your feature staging branch to `master`. A CI/CD will publish.
